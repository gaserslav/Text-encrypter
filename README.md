# Text-encrypter

## like a notepad but it uses AES encryption 

>how does it work?
<ol>
<li>create EMPTY file(its important to be empty otherwise program will thing that there is already encrypted data and will try to decrypt it with non existent key)</li>
<li>make up your password of course if you forget it that file is good as deleted </li>
<li>write something (and press encrypt(or decrypt) or just close program (it will save it before closing)</li>
  </ol>
