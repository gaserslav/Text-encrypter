# Text-encrypter
## It just encrypts text perfect for passwords

### it works on AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding so your key is generated by text so basically you need to remember password so you can read your other passwords



>Here is how it works 

1. Select empty file where will be all data stored

note:: its important to select empty file (because otherwise program will think that there is already encrypted data in that file and will try to decrypt it(it make you insert key))


2. Insert password that key will be generated from (remember it or you wont be able to access that file)
